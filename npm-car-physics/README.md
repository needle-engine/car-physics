# Needle Engine Car Physics

Add car physics to your Needle Engine projects with ease.


# Features

- **Works with any model** thanks for our automatic car detection:   
    *The CarPhysics component does automatically search for wheel objects and if none are found a default car rig is created*
- **Car Controller** component to quickly get started with keyboard and gamepad support
- **Car Radio** component to stream music (e.g. from lastfm)
- **Drag-Drop** component to drop any model on your website to drive around
- *Can be used with Unity to create filters, animations, materials...*
